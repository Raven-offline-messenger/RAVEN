# RAVEN Device Revocation V1

**Version:** 1
**Document revision:** **6** (exhausted retains exact claim; anchored exhausted marker; corrupt journal state)
**Record:** `RavenDeviceRevocationV1`
**Status:** **APPROVED** — companion under [`RAVEN_UNIFIED_SERVERLESS_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md`](RAVEN_UNIFIED_SERVERLESS_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md) (umbrella Document revision 2 permits bare public RVDR1)
**Approved:** 2026-08-16 — human/protocol-owner approval (independent technical review PASS: Py 11/11, Rust 10/10, Swift 12/12, clippy `-D warnings`)
**Approval prerequisites:** Umbrella **Approved** (met)
**Unblocks:** [`ATSAM_HYBRID_RATCHET_V2.md`](ATSAM_HYBRID_RATCHET_V2.md), [`RAVEN_ID_RESOLUTION_V1.md`](RAVEN_ID_RESOLUTION_V1.md) (their remaining gates still apply)
**Production:** **disabled** — companion APPROVED does not enable production/Release flags; umbrella §9–§10 and per-surface gates still required

This document freezes **signed device revocation**: how an identity retires a device lineage, how verifiers apply a sticky local deny decision, and what partitions can and cannot guarantee. It supersedes the “no dedicated revocation record” gap in [`RAVEN_IDENTITY_V1.md`](RAVEN_IDENTITY_V1.md) §2.1 for V2 production paths. Certificate issuance remains in Identity V1 (`RavenDeviceCertificateV1` has **no** certificate-generation field; this companion MUST NOT assume one).

**Umbrella invariants** remain binding. Companions cannot override them.

**Non-claim:** There is **no instant global revoke**. A partitioned verifier that has not received a revocation remains able to trust a still-unexpired certificate until it learns otherwise.

---

## 1. Threat model

### 1.1 Goals

| Goal | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Authorized retire | Only the owning **identity** Ed25519 key MAY mint a revocation for its devices |
| Sticky deny | An accepted revocation **never disappears** because a newer record arrives |
| Fail-closed apply | Once any covering revocation is accepted, crypto paths for that lineage fail closed |
| Eventual propagation | Revocations travel as ordinary endpoint objects; inventory/sync MAY help |
| Fork honesty | Concurrent valid owner mints may equivocate on metadata; **both** deny targets still apply |
| Partition honesty | Eventual consistency only; no push-to-all guarantee |

### 1.2 Non-goals

- Revoking an entire Raven identity / address.
- Server CRL / OCSP.
- PQ signatures.
- Automatic session healing after revoke (close; re-pair on a **new** device lineage).
- Using unsigned network gossip to authorize devices or clear revocations.

### 1.3 Adversaries

Network drop/reorder/inject; malicious relay withholding; stale views; compromised **device** keys; compromised **identity** key (can forge revokes — out-of-band recovery).

---

## 2. Device lineage target (normative)

A revocation permanently retires a **complete device lineage**, not merely the latest cert-hash row.

### 2.1 Covered identifiers

Every accepted record permanently denies **all** of:

| Identifier | Rule |
|------------|------|
| `device_id` | Exact bytes; MUST NOT be reused on a replacement device |
| `device_ed_pub` | MUST NOT be reused |
| `device_x_pub` | MUST NOT be reused |
| `device_cert_hash` | Exact PairInit-family cert digest of the retired certificate |

`device_cert_hash` continues to use:

```text
SHA-256(
  "rvn1/pair-devcert"
  || identity_ed25519_pub(32)
  || RavenDeviceCertificateV1.signing_bytes
  || certificate_signature(64)
)
```

### 2.2 Replacement device

A replacement MUST use a **new** `device_id` **and** new Ed25519 **and** new X25519 keys, with a new certificate. Reusing any of `{device_id, device_ed_pub, device_x_pub}` after revoke is a protocol violation; verifiers MUST treat such certs as unauthorized even if signatures verify.

### 2.3 `device_id` encoding

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Encoding | UTF-8 |
| Length | nonempty; **1..64** bytes (UTF-8 byte length, not Unicode scalars) |
| Wire | `u16be` length + exact bytes (`lp` with 2-byte BE length) |
| Equality | Exact byte compare; no Unicode normalization |

---

## 3. Wire record (frozen offsets)

Magic `RVDR1\0\0\0`, `version = 0x01`, `suite = 0x01`. Variable-length `device_id` / `issuer_device_id` use `u16be` length **1..64**.

For the frozen fixture `device_id = "bob-device-1"` (12 bytes) and `issuer_device_id = "alice-primary"` (13 bytes):

| Offset | Bytes | Field |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 8 | magic `RVDR1\0\0\0` |
| 8 | 1 | version = `0x01` |
| 9 | 1 | suite = `0x01` |
| 10 | 44 | `identity_address` ASCII |
| 54 | 2 | `device_id` length |
| 56 | 12 | `device_id` UTF-8 |
| 68 | 32 | `device_ed_pub` |
| 100 | 32 | `device_x_pub` |
| 132 | 32 | `device_cert_hash` |
| 164 | 2 | `issuer_device_id` length |
| 166 | 13 | `issuer_device_id` UTF-8 |
| 179 | 8 | `issuer_seq` u64be |
| 187 | 16 | `revocation_id` |
| 203 | 1 | `reason_code` |
| 204 | 8 | `created_at_ms` u64be |
| 212 | 64 | identity Ed25519 signature |
| **276** |  | **total length** (`offsets.total_len` in `valid_001.json`) |

**Signing bytes:**

```text
"rvn1/device-revocation" || version || suite
  || identity_address
  || lp(device_id) || device_ed_pub || device_x_pub || device_cert_hash
  || lp(issuer_device_id) || u64be(issuer_seq)
  || revocation_id || u8(reason_code) || u64be(created_at_ms)
```

Wire body without magic/signature equals `signing_bytes` without the domain prefix. Signed by the **identity** key for `identity_address`.

Hard reject: unknown version/suite, noncanonical address, id length out of range, zero `revocation_id`, bad signature, trailing bytes.

Vectors: `shared-vectors/rvn1/device_revocation/valid_001.json`, `shared-vectors/rvn1/negative/device_revocation_wrong_signer.json`.

---

## 4. Digests and packaging (frozen for V1)

### 4.1 Two digest domains

| Name | Definition | Used by |
|------|------------|---------|
| `revocation_record_bytes` | Exact signed `RavenDeviceRevocationV1` wire | Endpoint crypto |
| `claim_digest` | `SHA-256(revocation_record_bytes)` | Endpoint claim dedup / deny-set keys after verification |
| `endpoint_object_bytes` | Bytes admitted to carriers as the application object | Umbrella object identity |
| `object_digest` | `SHA-256(endpoint_object_bytes)` | Carriers, inventory, multi-path cancel |

Carriers MUST use **`object_digest` only** and remain opaque. Claim-level dedup by `claim_digest` MAY occur **only after** endpoint verification of `revocation_record_bytes`.

### 4.2 Propagation packaging (V1 choice)

**Frozen:** for Device Revocation V1, `endpoint_object_bytes = revocation_record_bytes` (bare `RVDR1` record), as an umbrella **immutable authenticated public endpoint record** ([umbrella Document revision 2](RAVEN_UNIFIED_SERVERLESS_ARCHITECTURE_V2.md)).

Consequently `object_digest = claim_digest` **under this packaging only**. Implementations MUST still compute and name both digests so a future packaging revision can wrap the record without collapsing domains.

**Disclosure (intentional non-confidentiality):** bare RVDR1 exposes identity address, `device_id`, both device public keys, cert hash, issuer device id, reason code, and timestamps to any carrier observer. This is an explicit design choice so revocation can propagate without a pairwise session. V1 does **not** claim confidentiality of revocation metadata. Sealed-envelope wrapping remains out of scope for V1 and would need a new revision + vectors.

---

## 5. Accept model: append-only union (no sequence safety gate)

Revocation is **deny-only and irreversible**. A valid identity-signed claim MUST be applied to the deny-set even if another claim shares an `issuer_seq` or arrives “out of order.”

### 5.1 Safety predicate

**Apply if and only if** the record passes §3 parse + identity signature + optional cert consistency (§5.3).

**Do not** use `issuer_seq` (or any global sequence) to drop a valid deny claim. `issuer_seq` is for issuer-local ordering, sync hints, and fork/equivocation **reporting** only.

### 5.2 Append-only store layout

Persist separately:

1. **`revoked_targets`** — append-only set of denied lineage keys under `identity_address`:
   - by `device_id`
   - by `device_ed_pub`
   - by `device_x_pub`
   - by `device_cert_hash`
   - each entry references `claim_digest`, `revocation_id`, `applied_at_ms`, `exact_record_bytes` (or content-addressed blob)

2. **`claims_by_digest`** — map `claim_digest → exact_record_bytes` (idempotent insert).

3. **`issuer_heads`** — optional metadata `(identity_address, issuer_device_id) → {highest_issuer_seq, claim_digest, fork_flags}` for UX/sync. Updating heads MUST NOT delete or shrink `revoked_targets`.

**Invariant:** accepting claim B with a “newer” `issuer_seq` MUST NOT remove targets introduced by claim A. An older revoked certificate MUST remain denied forever once applied.

### 5.2.1 Quotas and exhaustion (append-only)

Append-only stores are bounded. Draft defaults (freeze with vectors / deployment profile):

| Quota | Draft default |
|-------|----------------|
| Max claims per `identity_address` | 10_000 |
| Max total claim bytes per identity | 32 MiB |
| Max global claims (optional) | implementation-defined ≥ sum of per-identity caps |
| Emergency metadata reservation | Separate from claim quotas; MUST hold `IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` rows (with `claim_digest` + content-addressed exact bytes), `REVOCATION_STORE_CORRUPT` markers, and related journal metadata per affected identity |

On insert that would exceed a **claim** quota (§6.1.1 transitions to `PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` / durable exhausted marker — not an ambiguous keep-or-clear of `PENDING_REVOKE`):

1. MUST NOT evict or compact away any existing `revoked_targets` / claims.
2. MUST reject applying the new claim into the deny-set until capacity is expanded and the claim is replayed (§6.1.3).
3. MUST fail-closed **authorization for that identity namespace** while an exhausted marker is present (treat all its devices as unauthorized for PairInit/envelope/ACK/bind).
4. MUST surface exhaustion to logs/UX.

A malicious contact that floods valid signed claims therefore Deny-DoS’s **that identity’s** accept path, not other identities’ stores (unless a global cap is hit — then process-wide revoke-apply fail-closed until expanded).

### 5.3 Cert consistency (when local cert known)

If the verifier holds a certificate matching `device_cert_hash`, then `device_id`, `device_ed_pub`, and `device_x_pub` in the revocation MUST match that cert. Mismatch → reject this claim (do not apply a confused revoke). Absence of the cert is OK — still apply the signed lineage deny.

### 5.4 Idempotency and forks

Authoritative claim identity is **`claim_digest`**. `revocation_id` is issuer hygiene and observability only — **not** a safety gate.

| Case | Action |
|------|--------|
| Same `claim_digest` again | Idempotent success |
| Same `revocation_id`, different bytes, **both** validly identity-signed | **Union-apply both** deny targets; record `revocation_id` **collision/equivocation**; never leave the second target trusted |
| Different valid claims, overlapping or distinct targets | **Union-apply** all targets |
| Two valid claims, same `(identity, issuer_device_id, issuer_seq)`, different `claim_digest` | Surface **equivocation/fork**; **still union-apply both** |
| Unsigned gossip / relay hint | MUST NOT authorize a device, clear a signed revoke, or remove deny-set entries |

Owners SHOULD still mint unique `revocation_id` values; collisions are treated as equivocation signals, not as permission to drop a valid deny.

### 5.5 Local policy vs signed state

- **Local contact/device block** MAY always deny access even when a certificate is cryptographically valid and unrevoked.
- **Unsigned** network or local cache data MUST NOT authorize a device, MUST NOT clear signed revocations, and MUST NOT lower signed revocation state.
- Signed revoke accept only **adds** deny coverage (monotonic deny).

### 5.6 Authorization check

A peer device is **locally authorized** for PairInit / envelope / ACK / Noise expected-bind only if **all** hold:

1. Local contact policy allows the identity (and does not block that device);
2. A valid `RavenDeviceCertificateV1` verifies and is inside `[not_before, not_after)`;
3. None of `{device_id, device_ed_pub, device_x_pub, device_cert_hash}` appear in `revoked_targets` for that identity;
4. No durable `IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` marker is active for that identity (§6.1.3);
5. No durable `REVOCATION_STORE_CORRUPT` marker is active for the store scope that covers that identity (§6.0 / §6.2).

Natural cert expiry remains a backstop when no revocation has been learned yet.

---

## 6. Apply transaction (fail-closed, durable first)

SQL and protected storage are not one atomic cross-store transaction. Ordering MUST roll-forward. **Anti-rollback anchors live in protected storage**, not only inside SQL. The mutation lease is **non-reentrant**.

### 6.0 Load / recovery order (before any idempotent lookup)

On process start or before applying/serving authorization:

```text
1. If REVOCATION_STORE_CORRUPT marker is set → fail closed for that store
   scope; do not apply; await explicit repair (§6.2).
2. If PENDING_REVOKE or PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED exists:
     a. Acquire mutation lease (unless already held by crash recovery).
     b. Re-read exact_bytes from the journal.
     c. Strict-parse; recompute claim_digest; verify identity signature,
        identity_address binding, and optional cert consistency (§5.3).
        A protected journal alone is NOT proof of verification.
        On re-verify failure:
          write durable REVOCATION_STORE_CORRUPT
            {scope, journal_kind, observed_digest_or_none, reason}
            via SQL generation bump + FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR
            (emergency metadata capacity);
          only then clear the corrupt journal;
          fail closed until explicit repair — never “clear and forget”.
     d. If journal kind == PENDING_REVOKE (re-verify OK):
          apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease(
            exact_bytes, pending_already_written=true)
        If journal kind == PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED (re-verify OK):
          ensure_exhausted_anchored(exact_bytes) per §6.1.3
            (SQL marker + FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR if missing);
          MUST NOT auto-insert the claim;
          MUST NOT clear PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED here;
          MUST NOT treat this as a normal apply retry loop
            (expand+replay uses convert→PENDING then helper).
     e. Release lease if acquired here.
3. Read protected FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR {generation, store_hash} if present.
4. Read SQL revocation_store_generation / compute SQL store_hash.
5. Compare:
   - missing SQL after a finalized anchor existed → fail closed
   - SQL generation < anchor.generation OR hash mismatch → fail closed (rollback)
   - no anchor + empty SQL:
       allowed ONLY if this is a true first install
       (no pre-existing identity/security namespace on device).
       If any identity/security namespace already exists → fail closed
       (missing anchor is not “fresh empty”).
6. Only then perform claims_by_digest lookups or §5.6 checks
   (exhausted / corrupt markers still fail-close authorization).
```

### 6.1 Public entry: acquire lease then apply

For inbound verified claims **without** a pre-held lease:

```text
apply_verified_revoke(exact_bytes):
  1. §6.0 recovery/anchor checks as needed
  2. Acquire identity/revocation mutation lease
  3. claim_digest = SHA-256(exact_bytes)
  4. If claims_by_digest has claim_digest:
       reconcile_idempotent_claim(claim_digest)   # §6.1.2
       Release lease; return idempotent success
  5. Write PENDING_REVOKE journal
       {claim_digest, exact_record_bytes, generation_prev, store_hash_prev}
  6. apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease(
       exact_bytes, pending_already_written=true)
  7. Release lease
  8. Network I/O (if fan-out) OUTSIDE lease — never required for local deny
```

### 6.1.1 Helper: `apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease`

**Preconditions:** caller **already holds** the mutation lease; `exact_bytes` have been **cryptographically verified in this call path** (or just re-verified per §6.0); if `pending_already_written=true`, `PENDING_REVOKE` already matches `exact_bytes` / `claim_digest`.

**MUST NOT** reacquire the lease. **MUST NOT** overwrite an existing matching `PENDING_REVOKE` / `PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED`.

```text
apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease(
    exact_bytes,
    pending_already_written = false):

  claim_digest = SHA-256(exact_bytes)

  if claims_by_digest has claim_digest:
    reconcile_idempotent_claim(claim_digest)
    if pending_already_written: clear PENDING_REVOKE if it matches
    return idempotent success   # caller releases lease

  if not pending_already_written:
    write PENDING_REVOKE {claim_digest, exact_bytes, generation_prev, store_hash_prev}
  else:
    require PENDING_REVOKE.claim_digest == claim_digest
      and PENDING_REVOKE.exact_bytes == exact_bytes

  if insert would exceed §5.2.1 claim quotas:
    # Single frozen transition — exact claim bytes MUST survive:
    atomically replace PENDING_REVOKE with PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED
      {claim_digest, exact_bytes, identity_address, generation_prev, reason=quota}
    # PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED is STABLE until expand+replay succeeds.
    # Do NOT clear it after writing the SQL marker.
    ensure_exhausted_anchored(exact_bytes):  # §6.1.3
      SQL transaction (atomic, emergency metadata capacity):
        upsert IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED {
          identity_address,
          claim_digest,
          exact_record_bytes OR content_addressed_blob_ref,
          reason=quota
        }
        # exact bytes MUST be recoverable from marker blob and/or
        # PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED — both MUST agree on claim_digest
      + bump revocation_store_generation
      + store_hash includes exhausted-marker material
      Write protected FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR {generation, store_hash}
    return resource_exhaustion
    # Deny-set unchanged; authorization fail-closed via exhausted marker.
    # Normal recovery MUST NOT auto-retry claim insert (no infinite loop).

  SQL transaction (atomic):
    insert claim blob keyed by claim_digest
  + append lineage keys into revoked_targets
  + update issuer_heads / fork / revocation_id-collision metadata
  + upsert required CLEANUP_REVOKE work items (§6.3)
  + bump revocation_store_generation
  + store SQL copy of revocation_store_hash = H(canonical snapshot)

  Write protected FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR:
    {generation = new generation, store_hash = same H(...)}
  # MUST succeed before journal clear.

  Clear PENDING_REVOKE.
  return applied
  # Caller releases lease. Deny is live from SQL+anchor.
```

After a successful `applied` return, §5.6 MUST fail closed for newly denied lineage **immediately**. While `IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` is set, §5.6 fails closed for the **entire** identity namespace.

### 6.1.2 Idempotent reconcile

When `claim_digest` is already present, **do not** merely release:

1. Ensure `FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR` matches SQL generation/hash for current store; if SQL has the claim but anchor is behind/missing → roll-forward anchor write from current SQL commitment under lease.
2. Ensure all required §6.3 cleanup work items for that claim’s lineage exist; upsert any missing items.
3. Clear a stale matching `PENDING_REVOKE` if present.
4. Then return idempotent success.

### 6.1.3 Exhaustion automaton (normative)

```text
PENDING_REVOKE
  --quota--> PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED   # retains exact_bytes (protected)
            + IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED # SQL, in store_hash
            + FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR   # protected anti-rollback
            (PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED NOT cleared)

PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED + IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED
  --capacity expanded-->
      re-verify exact_bytes (from journal and/or marker blob)
  --under same lease-->
      convert PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED → PENDING_REVOKE (same exact bytes)
      # apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease accepts PENDING_REVOKE only
  --exact replay OK-->
      SQL atomic: insert claim + append targets + delete IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED
                  + cleanup upsert + bump generation
      + FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR
  --then-->
      clear PENDING_REVOKE
```

**Replay path (frozen):** the helper does **not** consume `PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` directly. Under the existing lease, implementations MUST rewrite the journal to `PENDING_REVOKE` with the same `exact_bytes` / `claim_digest`, then call `apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease(..., pending_already_written=true)`. Crash order is locked in `shared-vectors/rvn1/device_revocation/crash_replay_order_001.json`.

| State | Meaning | Auto-retry insert? |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` | Protected stable journal holding **exact** claim bytes until expand+replay | **No** |
| `IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` | SQL row included in `store_hash` / generation; fail-closed identity auth | n/a |

**Anti-rollback (normative):** `IDENTITY_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` lives in **SQL** and MUST be part of the canonical snapshot hashed into `revocation_store_hash`. Creating or clearing it MUST bump generation and write a new protected `FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR` **before** any related journal clear. A SQL-only marker without an updated anchor is non-conformant. Rollback that drops the marker while the anchor still attests a higher generation MUST fail closed (§6.0 compare).

The marker MUST store at least `identity_address`, `claim_digest`, and `exact_record_bytes` or a content-addressed blob of those exact bytes (emergency capacity). `PENDING_REVOKE_EXHAUSTED` MUST remain until successful anchored apply (or corrupt path §6.0); it is the primary crash-safe holder of exact bytes, with the marker blob as redundant recoverable copy.

Clearing exhaustion states is allowed **only** after the automaton’s successful expand → re-verify → convert → anchored apply path above (or explicit abandon solely when re-verify fails and `REVOCATION_STORE_CORRUPT` / operator repair records that decision — never silently drop a still-valid signed claim).

### 6.1.4 Canonical `revocation_store_hash` (frozen)

```text
canonical_snapshot =
  "rvn1/device-revocation/store-v1" || 0x00
  || u64be(generation)
  || u32be(n_claims)
  || for each claim in ascending claim_digest order:
       claim_digest(32) || u32be(len(exact)) || exact_record_bytes
  || u32be(n_exhausted)
  || for each exhausted in (identity_address, claim_digest) ascending:
       lp(identity_address ASCII) || claim_digest(32)
       || u32be(len(exact)) || exact_record_bytes
  || u32be(n_corrupt)
  || for each corrupt in scope ascending:
       lp(scope UTF-8) || u8(reason_code)

revocation_store_hash = SHA-256(canonical_snapshot)
```

Vectors: `store_hash_001.json`, `store_hash_exhausted_001.json`.

### 6.2 Store integrity

After successful initialization (explicit empty-store initialized anchor on true first install, or at least one apply/exhausted/corrupt anchor):

- Missing protected anchor (when identity/security namespace exists), missing/truncated SQL, or SQL behind the protected anchor MUST fail closed for device authorization under that store scope until repaired from backup / re-sync of exact claims.
- `REVOCATION_STORE_CORRUPT` MUST fail closed for the marked scope until explicit repair clears it under lease with a new `FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR`.
- Recovery always prefers journal roll-forward via §6.1.1 / §6.1.3, then anchor compare (§6.0).

### 6.3 Side effects (durable cleanup work items)

Deny is immediate from `revoked_targets`. Required cleanup items are inserted/upserted **inside the deny SQL transaction** (§6.1.1), not after journal clear:

| Work item | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `close_sessions(device_ed_pub)` | Sessions → REVOKED/CLOSED |
| `cancel_outbox(device)` | Cancel local outbound attempts targeting only that device |
| `ux_notify` | Optional |

Workers roll-forward these items until complete; success of cleanup MUST NOT reopen authorization. Idempotent path (§6.1.2) repairs missing items.

---

## 7. Propagation and partitions

### 7.1 Admit path

Owner or peer admits `endpoint_object_bytes` (bare RVDR1) with umbrella `object_digest`. Relays forward opaquely.

### 7.2 Learning paths

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| LAN / Internet / BLE | Admit exact object |
| Mailbox | Opaque store |
| Object Sync inventory | Advertise `object_digest` on authenticated peer-eligible links |
| PairInit preflight | Local `revoked_targets` only — no network fetch under lease |

### 7.3 Partition semantics

1. Eventual only; offline verifiers may trust until they apply a claim.
2. Relay withholding delays learning; does not unset applied denies.
3. UX MUST NOT claim “revoked everywhere” after local apply alone.
4. Owners SHOULD fan out exact `revocation_record_bytes` best-effort.

---

## 8. Issuance rules (owner)

Single lease; no re-entry into §6.1’s acquire path:

```text
1. §6.0 recover / anchor-check.
2. Acquire mutation lease (once).
3. Mint RavenDeviceRevocationV1 with identity key
   (full lineage; issuer_device_id; issuer_seq observability-only;
    fresh revocation_id — hygiene only).
4. Write PENDING_REVOKE with exact revocation_record_bytes
   (pending_already_written path).
5. apply_verified_revoke_under_existing_lease(
     exact_bytes, pending_already_written=true)
   → SQL deny + cleanup upsert → FINALIZED_REVOKE_ANCHOR → clear journal.
6. Release lease.
7. Only then admit endpoint_object_bytes to carriers; exact-byte retry.
```

Concurrent owner devices MAY mint while partitioned; verifiers union-apply (§5). Never reuse revoked lineage ids/keys (§2.2). **Forbidden:** network before step 5 success; calling `apply_verified_revoke` (which reacquires the lease) while already holding the lease.
---

## 9. Integration matrix

| Surface | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| PairInit V1/V2 | Consult `revoked_targets` before OTP claim / TR init |
| Hybrid Ratchet | Denied device → CLOSED |
| AckV2 / envelopes | Outer device signer vs deny-set |
| ID Resolution | DeviceSet excludes any denied lineage key |
| Local block | Always may deny; orthogonal to signed revoke |
| Relays | Opaque; `object_digest` only |

---

## 10. Shared vectors (conformance suite)

| Class | Path / covers |
|-------|----------------|
| `valid_001` | Wire, offsets, digests, verify |
| `store_hash_*` | Canonical snapshot + hash |
| `crash_replay_order_001` | Expand replay step order |
| `device_revocation_wrong_signer` | Negative verify |
| `union_001` | Append-only union of two claims |
| `collision_revocation_id_001` | Same `revocation_id`, different bytes → union + collision |
| `quota_machine_001` | Exhaustion → expand → convert → replay crash windows |
| `corrupt_journal_*` | Truncated / digest mismatch / bad signature + recovery fail-closed |
| `apply_gates_001` | PairInit V1/V2, Session, Message, ACK, Noise bind |
| `pending_binding_negatives_001` | `pending_already_written` wrong bytes/digest/missing/EXHAUSTED |

Reference: `protocol/reference/raven_protocol/device_revocation.py` (+ `_conformance`), `node/crates/raven-core/src/device_revocation*.rs`, `ios-native/.../RavenDeviceRevocation*.swift`.

**Parity:** core + conformance KATs green across Python/Rust/Swift (authorize executed vs fixture; pending binding enforced; full `revoked_targets` / collision compare).

### 11.2 Document control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Created | 2026-08-16 |
| Revision | **6** (+ conformance fixtures: union/collision/quota/corrupt/apply-gates/pending-binding; Py/Rust/Swift KATs) |
| Status | **APPROVED** |
| Approved | 2026-08-16 (human/protocol-owner; independent technical review PASS) |
| Next | Session companion vector freeze ([`ATSAM_HYBRID_RATCHET_V2.md`](ATSAM_HYBRID_RATCHET_V2.md)); ID Resolution may proceed on its prerequisites |
| Explicitly not next | Production flags / transport enablement |

**Production remains disabled** despite companion APPROVED until umbrella §9–§10 and relevant surface gates pass.
