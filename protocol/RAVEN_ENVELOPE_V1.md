# RAVEN Envelope V1

**Version:** 1 (`rvn1`)
**Status:** Wire layout frozen; production security hold. The mandatory
processing corrections in
[`SECURITY_ERRATA_RVN1_2026-08-13.md`](SECURITY_ERRATA_RVN1_2026-08-13.md)
override §6 where they conflict. See [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).
**Audience:** re-implementers of the wire codec and anyone writing a relay,
bridge, or transport adapter.

> This is the one wire object every transport carries unchanged — internet
> bridge, BLE mesh, or any future transport (invariants 5 and 6,
> [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md)). A transport MUST NOT decrypt, reformat, or re-derive
> fields of this envelope; it forwards the bytes.

## 1. Byte layout

Big-endian throughout. Fixed 86-byte prefix, then three length-delimited
variable fields, in this exact order.

| Off | Size | Field | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 4 | `magic` | ASCII `RVN1` = `0x52564E31` |
| 4 | 1 | `version` | `0x01` |
| 5 | 1 | `env_type` | 1=message, 2=ack, 3=alias-gossip, 4=capabilities |
| 6 | 2 | `flags` | bit0=hybridPQ, bit1=bleOriginated; rest reserved, MUST be 0 |
| 8 | 16 | `message_id` | 128-bit CSPRNG |
| 24 | 16 | `routing_tag` | `RavenRoutingTagV1` — recipient locator; rotates ([`RAVEN_ROUTING_TAG_V1.md`](RAVEN_ROUTING_TAG_V1.md)) |
| 40 | 8 | `dest_device_hint` | truncated hint or 0; **MUTABLE**, excluded from signature |
| 48 | 8 | `created_at` | unix ms |
| 56 | 8 | `expires_at` | unix ms |
| 64 | 1 | `hop_limit` | **MUTABLE**, excluded from signature |
| 65 | 1 | `replication_budget` | **MUTABLE**, excluded from signature |
| 66 | 12 | `anti_replay_nonce` | per-envelope |
| 78 | 2 | `hdr_len` | length of `ratchet_header_ciphertext` |
| 80 | 4 | `body_len` | length of `message_ciphertext` |
| 84 | 2 | `auth_len` | length of `sender_authentication` (Ed25519 sig = 64) |
| 86 | `hdr_len` | `ratchet_header_ciphertext` | opaque ATSAM/Noise header |
| … | `body_len` | `message_ciphertext` | opaque sealed frame (`RVNA1`/`RVNS1`/`RVNH1`) |
| … | `auth_len` | `sender_authentication` | Ed25519 signature over signing bytes |

86 bytes is the sum of the fixed-offset columns above (`4+1+1+2+16+16+8+8+8+1+1+12+2+4+2`).

**Vector:** `shared-vectors/rvn1/envelope/message_alice_to_bob.json` (`env_type=1`,
signed by alice's identity key; `packed_hex` is the full byte-for-byte wire
form).

## 2. Signing bytes — the mutable-field rule

Three fields are legitimately mutated in transit by relays: `dest_device_hint`
(a relay may refine or clear a delivery hint), `hop_limit` and
`replication_budget` (both decremented on each hop). Everything else in the
prefix, plus the ciphertext blobs, must be exactly what the sender wrote.

Canonical signing bytes are built by taking the fixed 86-byte prefix with the
three mutable fields **zeroed** and `auth_len` set to the canonical value `64`,
then appending `SHA-256(ratchet_header_ciphertext)` and
`SHA-256(message_ciphertext)`:

```
signing_bytes =
    prefix_with(dest_device_hint=0, hop_limit=0, replication_budget=0, auth_len=64)
    || SHA-256(ratchet_header_ciphertext)
    || SHA-256(message_ciphertext)
```

150 bytes total (86 + 32 + 32). `sender_authentication` is the Ed25519
signature over exactly this value.

This binds everything immutable — including the *lengths* and *content* of
both ciphertext blobs, via their hashes — and binds nothing a relay is allowed
to touch. This closes a class of flaw where a naive "sign the whole prefix"
scheme would either (a) force relays to re-sign on every hop-count decrement
(defeating end-to-end authentication), or (b) leave `hop_limit`/
`replication_budget`/`dest_device_hint` unauthenticated as a side effect of
being excluded, without that exclusion being an explicit, audited design
decision. Here it is explicit and by design: those three fields are *never*
part of what a signature promises, on purpose.

**Vector:** `shared-vectors/rvn1/envelope/message_alice_to_bob.json` carries
both `signing_bytes_hex` and `packed_hex` so an implementation can verify it
computes the same 150-byte signing input and the same signature.
**Tamper vector:** `shared-vectors/rvn1/negative/envelope_tampered_body.json`
— the same envelope with `message_ciphertext` altered *after* signing;
expected `verify_result: reject`, because the appended
`SHA-256(message_ciphertext)` no longer matches what was signed.

## 3. `env_type` registry

| Value | Meaning | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | message | this document (body only — content format is the ATSAM/Noise sealed frame, out of scope here) |
| 2 | ack | [`RAVEN_ACK_V1.md`](RAVEN_ACK_V1.md) |
| 3 | alias-gossip | [`RAVEN_ALIAS_V1.md`](RAVEN_ALIAS_V1.md) |
| 4 | capabilities | [`RAVEN_CAPABILITIES_V1.md`](RAVEN_CAPABILITIES_V1.md) |

`env_type` values above 4 are reserved. A receiver seeing an unrecognized
`env_type` under the currently-supported `version` should drop the envelope
(it cannot safely interpret `message_ciphertext`'s inner structure); this is
distinct from an unsupported `version`, which is a hard drop per
[`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md)'s versioning policy.

## 4. Size limits and known transport-level issue

The field widths alone bound `hdr_len` to 65,535 bytes and `body_len` to
4,294,967,295 bytes (4 GiB) — `auth_len` is a 2-byte field but MUST equal 64
for any `env_type` that requires an Ed25519 `sender_authentication`, per the
canonical signing-bytes rule in §2. No implementation should treat the field
widths as the real limit.

**Canonical V1 ceiling:** decoders MUST reject a packed envelope larger than
1,048,576 bytes before reading its declared variable lengths. The text sealer
has a tighter 256 KiB body ceiling. Media is outside the first serverless
milestone and MUST use a separately versioned bounded/chunked transport rather
than silently raising the canonical text-object limit.

> **Implemented transport guard (2026-08-13).** The legacy Go media bridge has
> a wider 24 MiB carrier frame for old server payloads; that does not make an
> oversized object valid RVN1. It still reserves the declared buffer before
> the envelope codec runs, because it must hand the
> exact opaque object across the Swift boundary. It now does so only after a
> non-blocking reservation: at most two inbound streams and one maximum-sized
> frame per remote peer, eight streams globally, and two maximum-sized frames
> globally. The idempotency-key field is capped at 512 bytes, every read has a
> deadline, and malformed, stalled, or over-budget streams are reset with all
> reservations released. Adversarial and race tests cover these limits. This
> bounds pre-validation allocation; deployments should still set lower policy
> limits when the text-only profile does not need the 24 MiB media-era ceiling.

## 5. "No plaintext identities on the wire"

None of the fixed-prefix fields, and neither of the two opaque
length-delimited blobs, carry a username, `userId`, alias, or
conversation/room identifier in the clear:

- `message_id` is random 128-bit CSPRNG output with no semantic meaning
  outside the sender/recipient's own local session state.
- `routing_tag` is a rotating HMAC output
  ([`RAVEN_ROUTING_TAG_V1.md`](RAVEN_ROUTING_TAG_V1.md)) that a relay cannot
  invert to any identity without holding the sender/recipient pair's
  `K_route`.
- `dest_device_hint` is explicitly a *hint*: it is mutable, excluded from the
  signature (§2), and MUST be treated by any receiver as unauthenticated —
  never as a verified recipient identity. Implementations MUST NOT put
  anything more identifying than a small opaque hint value in it.
- Everything with actual semantic content (message text, alias claims, ACK
  status, capability bits) lives inside `ratchet_header_ciphertext` /
  `message_ciphertext`, which are opaque to any party without the session key.

## 6. Incoming-processing pipeline

The original Phase A ordering wrote attacker-selected dedup identifiers before
authentication. That is unsafe and is superseded by the security errata. An
implementation MUST first determine whether it is acting as an endpoint or an
opaque relay. Each stage either rejects/stops or passes to the next stage.

### 6.1 Checks common to every role

1. **size** — reject the raw frame if it exceeds the transport's configured
   maximum before attempting to parse anything (§4).
2. **decode** — parse the fixed 86-byte prefix; total byte length must equal
   `86 + hdr_len + body_len + auth_len` exactly, or the envelope is malformed.
   **Vector:** `shared-vectors/rvn1/negative/envelope_bad_magic.json` — the
   `magic` byte zeroed; expected `unpack_result: reject`.
3. **version** — the `version` byte must equal the version this
   implementation supports. Higher → drop per [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md); this
   implementation treats it as a decode failure, but conceptually it is its
   own forward-compatibility gate, not "malformed."
4. **structure** — `env_type` is in the registry (§3), reserved `flags` bits
   are zero, and the declared lengths are internally consistent (already
   enforced by decode's total-length check, but revalidated here against
   `env_type`-specific expectations, e.g. `auth_len == 64`).
5. **TTL** — `expires_at` compared against the local validation clock; past
   expiry, the envelope is dropped by relays before further processing.
   **Vector:** `shared-vectors/rvn1/negative/envelope_expired.json` —
   `expires_at_ms` one second before `validation_clock_ms`; expected
   `relay_action: drop`.
6. **role/tag/session** — `routing_tag` is matched against locally-known sessions
   ([`RAVEN_ROUTING_TAG_V1.md`](RAVEN_ROUTING_TAG_V1.md)); if no local session
   recognizes the tag, the envelope is not an endpoint delivery. It may enter
   the opaque-relay pipeline below if local policy permits.

### 6.2 Endpoint-only pipeline

7. **read-only duplicate hint** — an implementation may check a bounded cache
   for a previously *authenticated* `(session, message_id, object_digest)` but
   MUST NOT insert or claim any identifier yet.
8. **authenticate device** — resolve the expected device from the session,
   validate its certificate/revocation state, then verify
   `sender_authentication` against `signing_bytes`
    (§2) using the sender's device Ed25519 key, resolved via a known session
    or `RavenDeviceCertificateV1` ([`RAVEN_IDENTITY_V1.md`](RAVEN_IDENTITY_V1.md)).
    **Vector:** `shared-vectors/rvn1/negative/envelope_tampered_body.json` —
    tampering after signing fails exactly here.
9. **decrypt and ratchet replay check** — only after authentication succeeds,
    hand
    `ratchet_header_ciphertext` and `message_ciphertext` to the session
    sealer. AEAD authentication, the directional receive index, and bounded
    skipped-key state decide replay acceptance; unverified
    `anti_replay_nonce` alone is not authoritative.
10. **atomic commit** — in one recoverable transaction, persist the receive
    ratchet/journal update, authenticated dedup receipt, inbox content, and an
    ACK-outbox intent. A failure rolls back all four; no plaintext is surfaced.
11. **ACK outbox** — only after commit, a worker transmits the sealed,
    independently signed `RavenAckV1` (`env_type=2`) per
    [`RAVEN_ACK_V1.md`](RAVEN_ACK_V1.md). A committed duplicate may resend the
    existing ACK intent but cannot create a second visible message.

### 6.3 Opaque-relay pipeline

7. **read-only object dedup** — check a bounded, expiring cache keyed by a
   digest of the immutable signing bytes plus outer signature. Do not insert
   an unverified `message_id`.
8. **local resource policy** — enforce per-peer byte/rate/queue ceilings before
   accepting custody. When the sender device key is resolvable, verify it; when
   it is not, treat the object as unauthenticated opaque data.
9. **cooperative hop policy** — require nonzero `hop_limit` and
   `replication_budget` before forwarding and decrement them for the next hop.
   These unsigned values bound compliant local behavior only; §2 does not make
   them a Byzantine-relay security guarantee.
10. **admit then mark seen** — atomically enqueue/forward-admit the opaque
    object, then record its immutable-object digest in the bounded replay
    cache. Admission failure writes no seen entry. Relays never decrypt message
    or ACK content and never advance endpoint delivery state.

## 7. Binding sealed content frames (`RVNA1` / `RVNS1` / `RVNH1`)

This section binds existing sealed-content magics into `message_ciphertext`
**without changing** the 86-byte prefix or signing-bytes rule above.

| Layer | Magic | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Outer transport object | `RVN1` (4 bytes) | Envelope offset 0 |
| ATSAM sealed body | `RVNA1\0\0\0` (8 bytes) | Start of `message_ciphertext` |
| Noise sealed body | `RVNS1\0\0\0` (8 bytes) | Start of `message_ciphertext` |
| Noise handshake | `RVNH1\0\0\0` (8 bytes) | Start of `message_ciphertext` |

Normative rules:

1. For `env_type = 1`, production `message_ciphertext` is an opaque sealed
   content frame (raw bytes on this binary wire — **not** base64). Base64 is
   a legacy MeshEnvelope/JSON encoding detail only.
2. `ratchet_header_ciphertext` is opaque to relays; length may be zero when
   the sealer encodes session state inside the body (e.g. RVNA1 v2 index).
3. Relays MUST NOT inspect or rewrite bytes inside either ciphertext field.
4. Codec test fixtures MAY use non-decryptable placeholder bodies to lock
   pack/sign layout (`shared-vectors/rvn1/envelope/message_alice_to_bob.json`
   does exactly that). Those placeholders are **not** ATSAM KATs.
5. Full primitive → threat → vector → implementation mapping:
   [`ATSAM_PRIMITIVE_MAPPING_V1.md`](ATSAM_PRIMITIVE_MAPPING_V1.md).

Mesh JSON (`MeshEnvelope`) remains the shipping BLE/app carrier until Phase G;
the target object for internet + eventual BLE is this `RavenEnvelopeV1`.
