//  WatchAuthKeyStore.swift  (Watch-side)
//  RAVEN-Watch
//
//  🔴 ROUND 26 (2026-05-16) — hacker-audit MESH-HIGH-3.
//
//  Companion to the iPhone's `WatchAuthKeyStore`. The iPhone ships a
//  per-install 32-byte AES key to this Watch over WCSession
//  `updateApplicationContext` whenever the session activates (see
//  `WatchBridgeService.publishAuthWrapKey` on the iPhone target). We
//  cache the key in the Watch's own Keychain — NOT in any App Group
//  — so that:
//
//    • The key is not visible to other processes via the App Group
//      container that the auth.json file lives in.
//    • The key survives Watch reboot (Keychain has its own persistence).
//    • Recovering the key requires both the Watch's Keychain AND
//      the encrypted token blob; neither alone leaks the bearer.
//
//  `RemoteAPI.token` checks for `raven.auth.token.enc` first; if
//  present AND we have a cached wrap key, it decrypts and returns
//  the plaintext token. Falls back to the legacy
//  `raven.auth.token` cleartext field if no wrap key is available
//  (e.g. first sign-in before the iPhone's first session activation
//  has shipped the key).
