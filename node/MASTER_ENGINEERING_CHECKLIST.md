# RAVEN Serverless Terminal Messaging

## Master Engineering Checklist

**Project:** RAVEN
**Primary objective:** Build a secure, decentralized text-messaging network that can be used from Windows, macOS and Linux terminals and can exchange messages with Raven mobile clients.
**Terminal entry command:** `ash`
**Canonical components:** `raven-node`, `raven-core`, `raven-cli`
**Initial scope:** One-to-one text messages only
**Primary priority order:** Security → Correctness → Interoperability → Reliability → Performance → UX

# 1. Completion Rules

No checkbox may be marked complete merely because code or documentation exists.

For every completed item, provide:

* [ ] The commit SHA containing the work.
* [ ] The exact files changed.
* [ ] Unit or integration tests proving the behavior.
* [ ] Negative tests proving invalid behavior is rejected.
* [ ] Security implications.
* [ ] Compatibility implications for Windows, macOS, Linux and iOS.
* [ ] Known limitations.
* [ ] Reviewer name or review record.
* [ ] Status: `DRAFT`, `IMPLEMENTED`, `REVIEWED`, or `FROZEN`.
* [ ] Evidence that unrelated Raven functionality was not silently changed.
* [ ] Evidence that no secret, credential or private key was committed.

A task is not complete if it:

* [ ] Works only on localhost.
* [ ] Works only with mocked peers.
* [ ] Depends secretly on the existing Raven API server.
* [ ] Works only when sender and recipient are simultaneously online.
* [ ] Works on only one operating system.
* [ ] Has no negative or adversarial tests.
* [ ] Requires plaintext messages to pass through a relay or bridge.
* [ ] Has not been tested after process termination and restart.
* [ ] Has documentation that disagrees with the implementation.

# 2. Non-Negotiable Product Requirements

* [ ] Raven text messaging must not require a trusted central message server.
* [ ] Raven text messaging must not require a central user database.
* [ ] Raven text messaging must not require a central routing database.
* [ ] Raven text messaging must not require Raven-operated infrastructure.
* [ ] Raven-operated bootstrap, relay or store nodes may exist only as optional and replaceable peers.
* [ ] Community members must be able to operate equivalent bootstrap, relay and store nodes.
* [ ] The network must continue operating between known peers when Raven-operated nodes are unavailable.
* [ ] A user must be able to install Raven and launch the terminal messenger using `ash`.
* [ ] Windows, macOS and Linux computers must be able to run persistent Raven nodes.
* [ ] Raven terminal nodes must exchange messages with Raven mobile applications.
* [ ] Text messaging must work over Internet P2P connectivity.
* [ ] Text messaging must work over local Bluetooth connectivity where supported.
* [ ] A Raven Bridge must forward messages between Bluetooth and Internet transports.
* [ ] A single logical message must retain the same message identity across every transport.
* [ ] Relay, bridge, bootstrap, DHT and store nodes must not be trusted with message plaintext.
* [ ] Messages must be encrypted on the sender endpoint and decrypted only on authorized recipient endpoints.
* [ ] Offline recipients must be able to receive messages later through encrypted store-and-forward.
* [ ] A relay accepting an envelope must not be reported as final delivery.
* [ ] Final delivery must require an authenticated acknowledgement from an authorized recipient device.
* [ ] The first release must remain limited to one-to-one text messaging.
* [ ] Groups, media, calls, feeds and social features must not delay the text-messaging foundation.

---

# 3. Exact Meaning of “Serverless”

For this project, serverless means:

> No trusted central application server, no mandatory central messaging service and no single authoritative infrastructure operator.

It does not mean that no device may listen for incoming connections.

* [ ] Document this definition in `docs/SERVERLESS_MODEL.md`.
* [ ] Explain that a Raven node may technically perform server-like functions for another node.
* [ ] Explain that relay, DHT, bootstrap and store functions are network roles, not trusted authorities.
* [ ] Prove that a user can connect using manually supplied peer addresses without a Raven-owned bootstrap server.
* [ ] Prove that known peers can continue communicating when all Raven-operated infrastructure is blocked.
* [ ] Ensure no network role has access to end-to-end message keys.
* [ ] Ensure no network role can create a valid message on behalf of an endpoint.
* [ ] Ensure no network role can silently alter the recipient of an encrypted message.
* [ ] Ensure no central service assigns or owns the cryptographic Raven identity.
* [ ] Ensure no central service is required to validate a Raven identity.
* [ ] Ensure no central service is required to store conversation history.
* [ ] Ensure no central service is required to report delivery.
* [ ] Ensure optional services are explicitly labeled optional.
* [ ] Do not use “serverless” in marketing until the mandatory serverless tests pass.

# 20. Terminal Command and Installation

* [ ] Detect whether an `ash` command already exists.
* [ ] Never overwrite `/bin/ash`, BusyBox `ash`, or another existing system shell.
* [ ] Never alter a user’s default shell.
* [ ] Never replace an existing executable without explicit informed consent.
* [ ] Use a user-scoped launcher or shell function where necessary.
* [ ] Provide a clear fallback to `raven` when `ash` conflicts.
* [ ] Document command-conflict behavior.
* [ ] Test command installation on Windows PowerShell.
* [ ] Test command installation on Windows Terminal.
* [ ] Test command installation on macOS zsh.
* [ ] Test command installation on macOS bash.
* [ ] Test command installation on Linux bash.
* [ ] Test command installation on Linux zsh.
