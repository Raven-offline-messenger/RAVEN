# `shared-vectors/` — cross-platform RAVEN test fixtures

This directory holds **deterministic, byte-exact test vectors** for every wire-protocol layer in RAVEN: crypto primitives, signing canonicalization, envelope encode/decode, BLE chunking, mesh routing, and trust.

Consumers:

- **iOS / Mac Catalyst** — `RAVEN-iOS/MeshV1/Tests` (SPM test target: `SharedVectorsTests.swift`, `SharedVectorsSignatureTests.swift`)
- **Android** — `RAVEN-Android/modules/mesh/src/test/kotlin/.../SharedVectorsTest.kt` (or via git submodule from `raven-android`)
- **Watch (read-only)** — observation-only; vectors not consumed there.

If you change a vector, **every consumer breaks**. That's the point — wire-protocol changes are coordinated across the fleet.

## Determinism

- **Fixed test keys** — RFC 8032 / RFC 7748-derived seeds. See `v1/identities.json`.
- **Fixed timestamp** — every vector uses `1700000000` (= 2023-11-14T22:13:20 Z) as its base epoch.
- **Fixed nonces** — counter-prefixed or RFC-derived; never random.
- **No "now"** — every output is reproducible. If you re-run `generate_v1.py` the files must be byte-identical.

## Regenerating

```sh
pip3 install --user cryptography
python3 shared-vectors/generate_v1.py
```

Then run `git diff shared-vectors/v1/` to confirm no changes.

If `git diff` shows changes after a regenerate, **one of these is true:**

1. The spec changed (intentional — coordinate with all consumers; bump to `v2/`).
2. A bug in `generate_v1.py` (revert the diff, fix the script).
3. A cryptography library version diff (Ed25519 / AES-GCM is deterministic — if outputs change, that's a serious red flag; pin the library version).

## Source of truth

The Kotlin scaffold at `RAVEN-Android/modules/mesh/` is the reference port targeting **v1**. The iOS app's current `MeshService.swift` is **out of sync with v1** (uses a different service UUID and a much simpler envelope). Bringing iOS up to v1 is tracked under [A1](https://github.com/Raven-offline-messenger/raven-android/issues/1).

Until iOS catches up, these vectors document what the wire **should** look like — not what it **does** look like on iOS today.

## `rvn1/`

`rvn1/` is the vector tree for the **serverless V1 protocol contract** — the wire format RAVEN moves to once it no longer depends on a central server (addresses, routing tags, envelopes, ACKs, aliases, device certs, capabilities). It is a distinct contract from `v1/` above (the original server-relayed / BLE-mesh protocol); the two are generated, versioned, and frozen independently.

- **Generator**: `protocol/reference/generate_rvn1.py`. Source of truth is the `raven_protocol` reference package (`protocol/reference/raven_protocol/`) — the same Python implementation exercised by the tests under `protocol/reference/tests/` (`cd protocol/reference && python3 -m pytest`).
- **Indexed-session profile**: `atsam/indexed_session_v1_*.json` is a separately
  identified, additive byte contract under the RVN1 outer-envelope tree. It
  freezes KDF/allocator/ACK interop but remains production-disabled pending a
  signed PairInit that negotiates and transcript-binds
  `ATSAM/indexed-session/v1`.
- **Consumers**: none yet in this repo. The Rust node (Phase B) is the first real consumer; the Swift, C#, and Kotlin ports vendor their own copies once each platform migrates off its legacy protocol onto `rvn1`.
- **Freeze rules**: `rvn1/` is frozen under the exact same rules as `v1/` in `VERSIONING.md` — once a vector lands it never changes; new edge cases get a new `_NNN` file; breaking changes require a new tree (`rvn2/`), not an edit in place.
- **Regeneration / drift check**: `tools/sync-vectors.sh` regenerates `rvn1/` from `generate_rvn1.py` on every run and fails (non-zero exit) if the regenerated tree differs from what's committed, so drift is caught automatically rather than relying on a manual `git diff`.
